## Legal / Compliance Pages

- [x] `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`, `/accessibility` routes + shared legal
      layout implemented (`docs/routes/legal-pages-spec.md`)
- [x] Baseline copy grounded in real stack (Resend, Turnstile, Upstash, Vercel,
      Sanity, form data) — clearly a working baseline, client counsel replaces
- [x] Wire `siteConfig.footer.legalLinks` to the new routes
- [x] Add legal routes to `content/seo.ts` + `sitemap.ts`

## Integration Readiness

- [x] Static content structure is stable enough for Sanity mapping
- [x] Placeholder imagery source is known (`lib/placeholder-images.ts` + `public/images/`)
- [x] Form integration scope documented (`docs/resend-integration-spec.md`)
- [x] Resend + React Email + Turnstile implementation (6 API routes, 7 form surfaces, dual-email delivery)
- [x] Email folder structure + dual UI documented (`docs/email-structure.md`)
- [x] Client mail host confirmed — **Zoho Mail** (`dev@`, `content@` created; temp passwords, rotate at handover)
- [x] Production form-delivery cutover checklist documented (`docs/production-form-delivery-cutover.md`)
- [ ] Resend domain verified + production env on Vercel (client ops)
- [x] `docs/cms-migration-spec.md` drafted — **approved with edits** (Codex/Claude review incorporated)
- [x] `docs/sanity-academy-spec.md` drafted — **approved with edits**
- [x] Sanity project + Phase 1 implementation (blog, webinars, courses, registration, hub, home, search, sitemap, revalidate webhook)
- [ ] Staging QA pass (edit in Studio → confirm hub/home/search/detail routes reflect it)
- [ ] Client sign-off on CMS scope — Phase 1 + Phase 2 (`docs/cms-client-summary.md`)
- [ ] Archive static catalogue arrays to `content/_archived/` (after staging QA)
- [ ] Production dataset migration + Vercel prod env cutover
