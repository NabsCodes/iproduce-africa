# Blog (Academy → Blog) Spec

## Status

Drafted 2026-06-24, revised after track-scope correction. **Static-first**:
build with placeholder content under `content/blog.ts`, no Sanity wiring in
this pass.

Blog is one **Academy track** alongside Webinars and Courses. All three
listing routes share `AcademyTrackHeroSection` (dark forest band + leaf
eyebrow pill). Blog adds a featured-article band and category filter on
top of the shared `TrackCardGrid` / `ContentCard` grid. See
[`academy-spec.md` → Track listing routes](./academy-spec.md#taxonomy-locked)
for the cross-track pattern; this file owns Blog-only behaviour (article
body blocks, sidebar, article SEO).

## Purpose

Make the Academy track's editorial output (long-form articles, market
insights, commentary) browsable and shareable. Gives the iProduce voice a
credible home for analysis pieces separate from the time-bound events /
training catalogue, and seeds a cross-promotion path into the paid Academy
courses via the detail page's related section.

## Confirmed inputs / constraints

- Lives at `/academy/blog` (listing) and `/academy/blog/[slug]` (detail) —
  inside the Academy parent surface.
- **Academy navbar architecture**: the Academy dropdown items currently
  point at hash anchors on `/academy`. The migration is **incremental** —
  repoint the Blog item now, leave the other three (Webinars / Courses /
  Events) as anchors until they ship. See [Navbar + footer migration](#navbar--footer-migration).
- Static-first MVP: no Sanity, no live submissions, no comments, no auth.
  Newsletter signup is placeholder UI (matches the footer newsletter form).
- Reuse existing primitives: `ContentCard`, `EyebrowPill`, `SiteCtaButton`,
  `CtaSection`. Motion primitives (`MotionFade`, `MotionStagger`) apply on
  day one — the full motion pass is shipped.
- **Shell-driven detail layout**: the blog detail page composes the shared
  Academy detail shell (slots: hero/media, metadata, main+sidebar, related,
  CTA). Future course / webinar / event detail pages reuse the same shell
  but fill the slots with their own metadata and renderers. **No universal
  "AcademyThing" component.**

## Routes (this pass)

| Route                  | File                               | Status                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/academy/blog`        | `app/academy/blog/page.tsx`        | **In scope today**                                                                     |
| `/academy/blog/[slug]` | `app/academy/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | **Shipped** — `generateStaticParams` over slugs                                        |
| Per-route 404          | `app/academy/blog/not-found.tsx`   | **Shipped** — first consumer of the deferred per-route 404 from `system-pages-spec.md` |

Sibling listing routes (shared hero, grid-only body for now):

| `/academy/webinars` | `app/academy/webinars/page.tsx` | **Shipped** — cards link to hub until slug pages ship |
| `/academy/courses` | `app/academy/courses/page.tsx` | **Shipped** — cards link to hub until slug pages ship |

Webinar / course **detail** routes are the next increment on
`AcademyDetailShell`. Events share the webinars track (no separate
`/academy/events` listing).

## Page 1 — Listing `/academy/blog`

### Section order

1. **Hero band** — full-width `bg-forest-900` (dark), centred content.
   Eyebrow pill: `INSIGHTS & RESOURCES`. Serif h1: _"Ideas Shaping African
   Agribusiness"_. Subtitle: _"Explore trends, perspectives, and practical
   insights driving innovation and growth across Africa's agricultural
   ecosystem."_ Generous vertical padding (~`py-20 sm:py-24`).
2. **Featured Article** — split layout, image left (rounded-xl, aspect
   ~5/4 on lg), content right: small `FEATURED ARTICLE` eyebrow + serif
   h2 + category chip + read time + 2-line description + outlined
   `Read more →` CTA. Stacks image-over-content on mobile.
3. **Category filter bar** — horizontal scroll on mobile, wraps on `sm+`.
   `All` (default, leaf-fill active state) + the **eight** categories from
   the design (see [Category set](#category-set)). Reuses the existing
   `Tabs`/pill primitive shape — same family as Academy's tab strip.
4. **Article grid** — 3-column on `lg:`, 2 on `sm:`, 1 on mobile.
   Existing `ContentCard` shape (image top, `category` chip + `meta` =
   read time, title, description). Hover lift already present.
5. **View More** — outlined button below the grid. The helper text below
   it (e.g. _"Showing 3 of 12 articles"_) **must reflect the actual
   collection count** — never hardcode "42" or any unconfirmed number. If
   the count helper is uncomfortable to ship until editorial volume is
   real, hide it entirely (the design's "42 articles" line is a placeholder
   and **must not** be published verbatim).
6. **Shared CTA** — existing `CtaSection`. The design shows the same dark
   `Let's Build the Future of Agriculture Together` band + "Partner with
   us" CTA we already ship.

### Featured-article selection rule

A single field on the listing content: `featuredArticleSlug: string | null`.
The listing resolves to the article matching that slug; if `null` or no
match, fall back to the **most recent article** by `publishedAt`.

Avoid `isFeatured: true` booleans on articles — that pattern guarantees
two articles will eventually both be flagged true and create ambiguity. A
single pointer is unambiguous and maps cleanly to a Sanity reference
later.

### Motion (inherits the shipped pass)

- Hero: dark band fades up once (`MotionFade`, single block).
- Featured article: `MotionFade` on the right-hand content column;
  image stays static.
- Category filter: no entrance motion (chips are interactive controls).
- Grid: header `MotionFade`; the ContentCard grid uses `MotionStagger`
  (cap 6 by default — first 6 stagger, remainder instant per spec rule).
- View More + CTA + footer: standard fades from the global pass.

## Page 2 — Detail `/academy/blog/[slug]`

Composes the shared Academy detail shell described in
[`academy-spec.md` → Detail-page shell](./academy-spec.md#detail-page-shell-shared-across-tracks).
Blog fills the slots like so:

| Slot               | Blog content                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **hero/media**     | Full-width hero image, ~aspect 21/9 on `lg:`, 16/9 on mobile, `rounded-xl`. No overlay text.                                                                               |
| **metadata**       | Category chip + read time + publish date (e.g. _"Jun 12, 2026"_, formatted via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`). No `date-fns`.                                                      |
| **main + sidebar** | Two-column on `lg:` (`grid-cols-[1fr_320px]`, `gap-12`), single column on mobile. Main = `<ArticleBody />`. Sidebar = `<StayInformedCard />` + `<ShareArticleControls />`. |
| **related**        | **"Continue Learning"** section — 3 related _courses_, not articles. See [Related section](#related-section-continue-learning) below.                                      |
| **cta**            | Shared `CtaSection`.                                                                                                                                                       |

### Article body

Lives in the main column. Plain prose — paragraphs, h2 subheadings,
bulleted and numbered lists. No pull-quotes or callout boxes in the
designs.

Body content is **structured blocks** (not MDX/HTML strings) — see
[Content shape](#content-shape) below.

### Sidebar — Stay Informed + Share Article

`<StayInformedCard />`: eyebrow + 1-sentence description + email input +
tangerine send-icon button. Mirrors the footer newsletter signup exactly
(placeholder UI; not wired).

`<ShareArticleControls />`: row of round icon buttons. **Drop Instagram —
it has no public web share intent and would be a dead control.** Ship the
four that actually work:

| Control     | Action                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| WhatsApp    | `https://wa.me/?text=${encodedTitle}%20${encodedUrl}`                                            |
| LinkedIn    | `https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=${encodedUrl}`                              |
| X (Twitter) | `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${encodedTitle}&url=${encodedUrl}`                        |
| Copy link   | `navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href)` + toast confirmation via existing `sonner` |

If the page is rendered inside a browser that exposes
`navigator.share()` (most mobile browsers), the X icon can swap to a
single "Share" button using the native sheet. Detect at runtime
(`typeof navigator !== "undefined" && "share" in navigator`), fall back
to the X intent otherwise.

### Related section ("Continue Learning")

The design shows three cards under what looked like "Related Articles" but
the meta reads `BEGINNER / 4 WEEKS`, `INTERMEDIATE / 6 WEEKS` — those are
**courses**, not articles. Resolved as: this is a cross-promotion into the
Academy track.

Heading: **"Continue Learning"** (or "Related Courses" if the user
prefers — the section name is editorial). Source data: **a course preview
projection from `academyContent.courses`** — same pattern used by Home
(`academyHomePreview`). The blog content module does **not** redeclare
course data.

```ts
// content/academy.ts — already owns courses; add a preview projection
export const academyBlogRelatedCourses = academyContent.courses
  .slice(0, 3)
  .map((course) => ({
    slug: course.slug,
    title: course.title,
    image: course.image,
    level: course.level,
    durationWeeks: course.durationWeeks,
    href: `/academy/courses/${course.slug}`, // resolves once course routes ship
  }));
```

If course detail routes don't exist yet, the cards' `href` should still
point at `/academy/courses/{slug}` — those URLs will work once the courses
section is built; until then, the blog detail page is the only thing
linking there, and the 404 it surfaces is the correct signal (the link
isn't dead, the route just hasn't shipped).

When the related section evaluates to fewer than 3 courses (or a course
preview needs to be omitted because its detail page hasn't shipped), the
grid renders only the items that resolve, never a stub or skeleton.

### Motion

- Hero image: `MotionFade` with `scaleFrom={0.98}`, `duration={0.48}` —
  spec's single-featured-panel rhythm.
- Article body, sidebar, share controls: **no entrance motion** — per
  spec rule "motion density decreases as content density increases".
  Sidebar's sticky positioning is the only kinetic detail.
- Related section: header `MotionFade` + `MotionStagger` on the 3-card
  grid.
- CTA + footer: standard.

## Category set

The design shows **eight** categories (Codex correction — earlier draft
missed _Community_):

`Innovation`, `Trade`, `Smart Agriculture`, `Agribusiness`, `Policy`,
`Market Insights`, `Sustainability`, `Community`.

Plus the `All` chip in the filter bar.

The TypeScript category type is **derived from the data**, not
hand-maintained:

```ts
// content/blog.ts
export const blogCategories = [
  "Innovation",
  "Trade",
  "Smart Agriculture",
  "Agribusiness",
  "Policy",
  "Market Insights",
  "Sustainability",
  "Community",
] as const;
```

```ts
// types/blog.ts
import { blogCategories } from "@/content/blog";
export type BlogCategory = (typeof blogCategories)[number];
```

Editorial can grow the list by appending to `blogCategories` — the type
follows.

## Content shape

**`types/blog.ts`** — contracts only:

```ts
import type { blogCategories } from "@/content/blog";

export type BlogCategory = (typeof blogCategories)[number];

export type BlogArticleBlock =
  | { kind: "paragraph"; text: string }
  | { kind: "heading2"; text: string }
  | { kind: "list_unordered"; items: readonly string[] }
  | { kind: "list_ordered"; items: readonly { title: string; body: string }[] };

export type BlogArticle = {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  category: BlogCategory;
  readTimeMinutes: number; // renders as "5 MIN READ"
  publishedAt: string; // ISO 8601 → formatted via Intl.DateTimeFormat
  image: string;
  imageAlt: string;
  excerpt: string;
  body: readonly BlogArticleBlock[];
};

export type BlogPageContent = {
  hero: { eyebrow: string; title: string; description: string };
  newsletter: { eyebrow: string; description: string };
  featuredArticleSlug: string | null;
  articles: readonly BlogArticle[];
};
```

**`content/blog.ts`** — data only. Imports its types from `types/blog.ts`;
does not declare types itself.

```ts
import type { BlogArticle, BlogPageContent } from "@/types/blog";

export const blogCategories = [
  /* the 8 categories above */
] as const;

const articles: readonly BlogArticle[] = [
  /* 9–12 placeholder articles */
];

export const blogContent: BlogPageContent = {
  hero: {
    /* ... */
  },
  newsletter: {
    /* ... */
  },
  featuredArticleSlug: "unlocking-intra-african-trade",
  articles,
};
```

### Date formatting

Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. Adding `date-fns` for a single date format
is unjustified weight.

```ts
const dateFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
  month: "short",
  day: "numeric",
  year: "numeric",
});
// "Jun 12, 2026"
```

Hoist to module scope so the formatter is built once.

## Sanity migration (post-MVP, documented for the doc)

Structured blocks are **not** a drop-in Portable Text shape. Sanity's
Portable Text uses `_type`-discriminated objects with span-marked text;
our `BlogArticleBlock` is a simpler tagged union. The CMS migration will
need either:

- a small **adapter** that maps Portable Text → `BlogArticleBlock`
  (cleanest: keep the renderer stable, swap data source), or
- a **GROQ projection** that emits `BlogArticleBlock`-shaped output
  directly (cleaner Sanity-side; more brittle if Sanity schemas change).

Either works. The renderer is the asset to protect — keep it pure on
the `BlogArticleBlock` shape regardless of source.

## Navbar + footer migration

The Academy dropdown and the footer's Academy column both currently
point Blog at `/academy#blog`. Migrate **only the Blog entry** in this
pass:

| Surface | File                    | Before          | After (this pass)  |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Navbar  | `content/navigation.ts` | `/academy#blog` | `/academy/blog` ✅ |
| Footer  | `content/site.ts`       | `/academy#blog` | `/academy/blog` ✅ |

**Blog/Insights stays in both the navbar dropdown and the footer Academy
column** — keep the existing IA. Don't remove it from the footer because
the design composition for Webinars/Trainings/Courses/Events doesn't
include it; we're not in a position to drop discoverability without
explicit editorial direction.

Webinars / Courses / Events footer + navbar entries keep their hash
anchors until those routes ship. Repointing those would surface a 404 in
chrome — worse UX than the current anchor scroll.

## Open questions for the user

Only ones still load-bearing after the Codex review:

1. **Related section heading** — Codex defaulted to "Continue Learning"
   (my preference) or "Related Courses". Either lands well; pick one.
2. **Category set future-proofing** — the eight are locked for the MVP.
   Confirm editorial doesn't expect more in the immediate next pass.
3. **Featured article identity** — which existing/placeholder article fills
   the `featuredArticleSlug` slot in the seed data? (If unsure, default to
   the most recent placeholder; editorial swaps later.)

## Out of scope (this pass)

- Webinars / Courses / Events listing + detail pages and their routes —
  no placeholder `notFound()` routes are created either; routes appear
  when designs do.
- Sanity wiring — content stays in `content/blog.ts`, with the adapter
  note above documenting the migration boundary.
- Search.
- Author / tag / archive-by-month pages.
- Comments / reactions.
- Real newsletter wiring.
- Auto-calculated read time (`readTimeMinutes` is authored).
- RSS feed.

## Verification

1. `pnpm format && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` — clean.
2. Routes resolve in the build manifest: `/academy/blog` and one entry
   per article slug; no orphan Webinars/Courses/Events routes.
3. Browser walk at 390 / tablet / 1440:
   - Listing: dark hero reads cleanly, 8 category pills wrap on `sm+` and
     horizontal-scroll on mobile, grid is 1/2/3 columns, View More
     doesn't shift layout, helper count reflects actual collection size.
   - Detail: hero scales without overflow, sidebar sticks on `lg:` and
     stacks on mobile, share controls fire (test each: WhatsApp opens
     wa.me, LinkedIn opens sharing URL, X opens intent, copy-link copies
     and toasts), Continue Learning cards link to
     `/academy/courses/{slug}` (404s gracefully until courses ship).
4. Reduced-motion sweep: hero image scale-in collapses; related stagger
   collapses; sidebar sticky behaviour stays.
5. Per-route 404: visit `/academy/blog/does-not-exist` → blog-scoped
   not-found, not the root one.
6. Lighthouse on `/academy/blog` and one detail page (record in the
   implementation-log row).

## Checklist

- [x] Open questions resolved (related heading: Continue Learning; categories locked for MVP; featured slug: unlocking-intra-african-trade)
- [x] `types/blog.ts` (contracts) + `content/blog.ts` (data) — no type/data overlap
- [x] `app/academy/blog/page.tsx` + `[slug]/page.tsx` + `not-found.tsx`
- [x] Shared detail shell primitive(s) created under `components/academy/detail-shell/` (or equivalent) — slots: media, metadata, main+sidebar, related, CTA
- [x] Blog-specific section components (hero, featured, filter, grid, body, sidebar cards, share, continue-learning)
- [x] `Continue Learning` consumes `academyContent.courses` projection — no course data in `content/blog.ts`
